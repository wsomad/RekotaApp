# Task Management App

This is an ongoing personal project that I developed to facilitate my daily task management. Personally, I can't find any application in the market today that can fulfil my preferences. Therefore, I come up with an idea of creating my own task management application.

## Project Features:

1. Build on Flutter framework specifically for Android platform
2. Based on the MVC architecture.
3. Utilizing SQLite to store task data especially in offline situation.
4. Integrating Firebase services such as Authentication and Realtime Database that can allowing me to use the application from different devices with the same account.
